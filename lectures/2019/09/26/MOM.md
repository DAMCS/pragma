# Session
1. Everyone must have a Github account, if you don't have one create it. We will need it for the next session
2. Also sign up for a Github Student Developer pack. It is optional but there are lot of premium features that come as free with the pack, so don't miss it.
3. We spoke about how syntactic structures in the language have similar functionality but are different interms of their semantics
4. Then we broke down Matrix Multiplication down along the layers of abstraction from `python` to `assembly`
5. We emphasized on abstraction as key factor in the evolution of techonolgy but in the future sessions we will break the abstraction layes to uncover opportunities for
    - Performance
    - Portability
    - Security
    etc.
6. We will also build right abstraction layers to achieve the above
